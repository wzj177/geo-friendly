    body: `aeo.js is a zero-dependency build-time library that transforms any website into an AI-discoverable resource. Founded in 2024, the project addresses a critical gap: most websites are invisible to AI crawlers because they lack the structured files that LLMs and answer engines require.

The library works by scanning your built HTML pages, extracting content, and generating a suite of standardized files. These include robots.txt with AI-specific directives, llms.txt summaries, sitemap.xml, Schema.org JSON-LD structured data, and per-page markdown files that AI systems can parse directly.

Unlike traditional SEO tools that focus on search engine rankings, aeo.js targets the emerging ecosystem of AI-powered search — ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Bing Copilot. These platforms need structured, machine-readable content to generate accurate citations and answers.`,
